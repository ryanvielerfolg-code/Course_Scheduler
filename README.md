# Course_Scheduler

This is a course_scheduler project conducted by EURECOM students Valentin and Yangtao

❓How to use it：

For now it's version 1.0, you need to upload two files:
1️⃣ groupwise_course_tags_fall2025.xlsx
2️⃣ number-of-students-fall-2024-extracted.csv

Those are the two "input" of the main function: ** Course_scheduler.py **

The website was deployed through Vercel.com, which offers a free-deployment and domain.
You can access the website through this domain: https://course-scheduler-henna.vercel.app/

Upload the required input files listed above, and you will get a course-timetable, also avaliable for you to download.
